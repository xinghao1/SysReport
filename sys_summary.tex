The following document outlines the critical requirements of the robotic system/subsystems involved in the development and maintenance of a future lunar Outpost. Firstly, the system requirements are clearly defined, and sub-categorized appropriately into functional, constraints, environmental, or performance requirements. Next, the seven subsystems of the proposed robotic system are illustrated in a System Block Diagram, with arrows to indicate relationships between the subsystems, as well as with various external interfaces. The subsystem requirements are then discussed in more detail, while providing a basic System Hierarchy Diagram that shows the relationship between the robotic system and its subsystems. Finally, key drivers including weight, power, payload handling, inspection performance, and durability against foreign objects are identified, followed by an analysis of the important mechanical, electrical, control/software trade-offs. It was decided that a semi-autonomous system, a mix of PTCS and ATCS, a backup Ground Control communications, and a battery backup shall be used.
