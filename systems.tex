\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}
The International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) has identified the human-robot exploration of Mars as the next ultimate step in space exploration \cite{RFP}. To facilitate various missions and objectives of different nations on the Moon, asteroids, Mars and beyond, a lunar Outpost stationed at Earth-Moon Lagrange point 2 (EML2) was recently proposed. EML2 is a strategic area being the farthest Lagrange point from the Earth with minimal gravitational effects \cite{HphyEML}. However, with increasing distance away from the Earth, the amount of mass being carried becomes more critical. Hence, Canada's next generation of space robotics needs to prove itself useful enough to be taken as a key component of the lunar Outpost.

In response to MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.'s (MDA's) Request for Proposal (RFP) \cite{RFP}, this report outlines the systems aspect of the project. \Cref{sect:sysreq} provides details on the system requirements, while \Cref{sect:SBD} illustrates the System Block Diagram. Then, \Cref{sect:SHD} shows the System Hierarchy Diagram, and \Cref{sect:subsysreq} outlines the subsystem requirements. Finally, \Cref{sect:drivers} identifies the key drivers, followed by a discussion of the important trade-offs in \Cref{sect:tradeoffs}.

\section{System Block Diagram}
\label{sect:SBD}
\Cref{fig:SBD} on the next page illustrates the System Block Diagram, showing the complex interfaces between the internal subsystems of the robotic system, as well as the internal-external subsystem interfaces. To keep the figure clean, many details about the interfaces between any two subsystems were not shown in the figure, and will be explained on the following page.
\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.9\textheight]{SBD}
\caption{System Block Diagram}
\label{fig:SBD}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}
The complex number of different interfaces were categorized into general categories: mechanical, power, data, and other. In addition, double arrows indicate a two-sided relationship, whereas a single arrow is used to indicate a mainly one direction of interaction. Firstly, mechanical interfaces can be described as any sort of physical interfaces between two subsystems. For example, the end-effectors mechanically attach to the Outpost, astronauts during EVA, and provide a connection for many of the sensors. Secondly, power interfaces refer to the electrical power required to operate the robotic system. The power subsystem provides power to all the other internal subsystems (except the frame), and receives power from the Outpost and the transport vehicle. 

\vspace*{3pt}
Thirdly, data interfaces are very general, and refer to the sensor data, commands, and other communications being sent/received. In most cases, a combination of these different types of data is exchanged. Fourthly, an ``Other" interface occurs between the foreign objects and robotic system, which refers to the micrometeoroids, subatomic particles, and other debris that may physically interact with the robotic system. Moreover, the ``Other" interaction between stellar bodies and the robotic system refer to the emission of radiation, and the presence of microgravity.

\vspace*{3pt}
As there are a large amount of interfaces between the external subsystems themselves, it was deemed appropriate to omit these interfaces and focus on the internal-external interfaces. It is also important to note that the ``Communications Network" is a vast subsystem that starts on the Earth and up to and beyond the Outpost, hence it is situated in an overlapping position between the different block categories.

\section{System Hierarchy Diagram}
\label{sect:SHD}
The following diagram demonstrates the overall hierarchy of the robotic system:

\section{Drivers}
\label{sect:drivers}
The following five requirements are identified as the key design drivers, which will heavily influence the outcome of system design.
\subsubsection*{S-F-04: Shall perform regular inspection of the Outpost}
The requirement that the system be able to perform regular inspection of the Outpost influences the locomotion and power subsystem designs. An actuator with sufficient torque to allow the system move around the Outpost and a power subsystem which provides sufficient power to the actuators will be required. In addition, the sensor subsystems have to be accurate enough to inspect the condition of the Outpost, while the data handling subsystems should be able to process all the data collected in order to give commands on maintenance and repair operations.
\subsubsection*{S-P-05: Shall be able to cover TBD \% of Outpost}
The requirement that the system has to be able to cover TBD \% of Outpost influences the locomotion and end-effector design, as well as the positioning of sensors to ensure that the sensor subsystem is able to analyze the Outpost in detail. In addition, design decisions regarding how the system is able to reach to the ends of the Outpost would also have to be decided. Naturally, the frame subsystem is affected as the design of the robotic system changes.
\subsubsection*{S-C-01: Shall have a mass of less than 450 kg}
The constraint on mass affects the design of all subsystems. This driver influences the materials chosen for the frame, and end-effector subsystem. Additionally, the method of power supply, the types and amounts of sensors used on the robotic system is affected, as well as the hardware of the data handling, and thermal control subsystem. All these design decisions need to be made to fulfill the overall mass requirement. Moreover, the weight of the whole system will also have an influence on the method of shipment.
\subsubsection*{S-C-04: Average power usage of less than 450 W}
The power constraint influences all electrical components of the robotic system. It affects the types of sensors selected, the method of power supply and power backup, as well as the hardware choice of the data handling and processing, and thermal control subsystems. In order to complete all the operations within the power constraint, the mobility method of locomotion subsystem and electrical hardware of the data handling subsystem will also be influenced.
\subsubsection*{S-E-08: Shall withstand strikes by foreign objects traveling at TBD m/s}
This environmental requirement influences the material used for the frame and the thickness of the frame, and will therefore influence the structure design of the whole robotic system, while limiting the amount of mass allocated to other subsystems. In addition, this requirement affects the sensors selected, restricts the material of the camera lens and materials of other components on the robotic system that interfaces with the external environment. Furthermore, precautions must be taken to ensure that the end-effector subsystem can operate in such an environment.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Trade-offs}
\label{sect:tradeoffs}
In this section, the major trade-offs in the design of the system will be discussed within three broad categories: mechanical, electrical and control/software. The text colors in the following tables correspond to desirability, with red being least , green being most desirable, and yellow being moderately desirable.
\subsection{Mechanical Trade-offs}
\subsubsection{Level of Autonomy}
The level of autonomy will determine how the operations should be planed and carried out, and will largely influence the design of data handling and control systems. Therefore, it should be discussed here as one of the major trade-offs. Three levels of autonomy are considered and compared, which are listed below and compared in \Cref{table:auto}. A limited-autonomous system requires Requires manual operations by the Outpost crew to complete all tasks, a semi-autonomous system shall be able to conduct basic tasks automatically, like change positions, but will require manual control by Outpost crew to complete more complex tasks while a fully-autonomous system shall be able to complete both all tasks without human intervention. 
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Trade Study for Level of Autonomy}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{4.1cm}|P{4.1cm}|P{4.0cm}|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{Limited Autonomous}	&	\textbf{Semi Autonomous}	&	\textbf{Fully Autonomous}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{System Complexity}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Easy to develop\newline Rich technological heritage}	&	\textcolor{orange}{Existing similar systems\newline Need software development for the specific operations}	&	\textcolor{red}{Technology is hard to achieve\newline Full software development needed}	\\\hline
\textbf{System Reliability}	&	\textcolor{red}{Operation is fully monitored, but human errors may occur}	&	\textcolor{orange}{Simple tasks may be affected by software and component malfunctions\newline Complex tasks may be affected by human errors}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Operation could be under software and component malfunctions\newline Human error is avoided.}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Duration}	&	\textcolor{red}{Requires control from the Outpost crew or Ground Control\newline Communication delays will extend the operation duration, average delay is between seconds to up to 20 minutes \cite{NASAcomm}}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Short for simple tasks}\newline\textcolor{orange}{Longer duration for more complex tasks, assistance from Outpost crew is required}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{ No human input required\newline Can operate continuously}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Accuracy \& Deviation from plans}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Accuracy is high due to manual control}\newline\textcolor{orange}{May be affected by human errors\newline Deviation from plans is limited by human control}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Accuracy will not be limited by computational resources for simple tasks\newline Human errors and robotic malfunctions are limited due to the cooperation between human and system\newline Deviation from plans limited}	&	\textcolor{orange}{Accuracy level limited by computational resources\newline Deviations may happen due to software or component malfunction\cite{NASAauto}}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:auto}
\end{table}

While a fully autonomous system would be ideal for space exploration because it would have high capabilities and efficiency, there are still technical, computational, safety and managerial challenges to overcome before achieving full autonomy. Therefore, taking current technology availability into consideration, a semi-autonomous system has been selected for this robotic system. This will allow the system to perform with relatively lower risk and higher efficiency.

\subsubsection{Passive vs. Active Thermal Control}
Thermal regulation systems are required in the system to ensure that temperatures of the system’s parts are within the operating ranges. There are two main types of such systems, Active Thermal Control System (ATCS) and Passive Thermal Control System (PTCS). 

ATCS makes use of various heating and cooling tools, such as electric heaters, fluid loops and thermoelectric coolers to control the temperature within the system while PTCS makes use of insulation to reduce heat transfer and surface coatings which modify the thermal or optical properties of the surface. These two systems are compared in \Cref{table:thermal}.
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Trade Study for Type of Thermal Control System}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{6.35cm}|P{6.35cm}|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{ATCS}	&	\textbf{PTCS}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|}
\textbf{System Complexity}	&	\textcolor{red}{Complex control system needed to respond rapidly to temperature fluctuations}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Only mechanical parts are added\newline Only increases mass, not complexity}	\\\hline
\textbf{System Reliability}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Outpost crew can manually control the temperature in case of breakdown in control system}\newline\textcolor{orange}{In case of breakdown of the heating and/or cooling elements, only solution is to repair them}	&	\textcolor{red}{Damage will result in loss of ability to maintain other subsystems at their operational temperature ranges}	\\\hline
\textbf{System Efficiency}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{System can be on Standby mode when temperatures are within operating ranges\newline Only needs to be switched on when temperature is near the limits of operation; Saves power and does its job}	&	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{System can reduce heat transfer without using any power; Very efficient when there is alternating high and low temperatures}\newline\textcolor{orange}{System is unable to regulate temperatures when there is prolonged periods of extreme temperatures}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:thermal}
\end{table}
\newpage
It is decided that our robotic system will have a combination of Active and Passive Thermal Control Systems. The main system will be the passive system to slow down the rate of heat transfer between internal components and the exterior environment. The active system will activate when there is excessive heat transfer that the passive system is unable to manage, or when there is damage to the passive system. This allows us to achieve the advantages of power saving and single-fault tolerance in the thermal control system, but we would have to accept the consequence of increasing the mass of the system and designing a more complex control architecture for the active system.

\subsection{Electrical Trade-offs}
\subsubsection{Need for an Independent Power Generation System}
In order to provide the system with an independent power supply, power generators, such as solar panels, will need to be included as part of the system. This would significantly increase the complexity and weight of the system. In addition, as the system is not expected to spend a prolonged period of time detached from the Outpost, it is decided that the system will not have its own power generation unit and would instead be powered entirely by the Outpost. However, the system will have a power storage system which will be charged while the system is connected to the Outpost and can be used when there is a loss in connection between the Outpost and the system.

\subsection{Control/Software Trade-offs}
\subsubsection{Need for Direct Communications with Earth-based Ground Control}
Having a direct communications link with Ground Control would allow Ground Control to control the system in cases of a breakdown in connection between Outpost and system. However, in order to create such a link would require the addition of a communications subsystem in the robotic system and the setup of a communications network to handle such communications. The power required for the operation of a communications system is relatively low at about \SI{15}{\watt} to \SI{30}{\watt}\cite{Marscomm} and the mass is low compared to the maximum mass constraints of the robotics system. In addition, although there will be a time lag in command signals, it is not extremely long to cause impracticalities in conducting Earth-based teleoperation\cite{roboserve}. Hence, it has been decided that our system will contain a communications subsystem to communicate with Ground Control through various communications networks already in place. This will allow for emergency operation of the system from Earth in cases of a loss of communication between the Outpost and system.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
In this report, the top-level requirements of a robotic system for the development and maintenance of a lunar Outpost were discussed. This was followed by an illustration of the seven robotic subsystems  frame, power, end-effector, data handling and processing, thermal control, sensors, and locomotion) in a System Block Diagram, showing the various interfaces between the robotic subsystems and external subsystems. Next, a System Hierarchy Diagram was displayed, followed by a detailed list of the numerous subsystem requirements. Additionally, the key drivers were identified, including weight, power, payload handling, inspection performance, and durability against foreign objects. Finally, the major mechanical, electrical, and control/software trade-offs were discussed. It was decided that a semi-autonomous system, a mix of PTCS and ATCS, a backup Ground Control communications, and a battery backup shall be used.
